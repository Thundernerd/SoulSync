# Visual baselines

Screenshot tests for the main routes, so a CSS refactor can prove it changed
nothing it didn't mean to.

```sh
npm run test:visual          # build, then compare every shot with its baseline
npm run test:visual:update   # build, then rewrite the baselines
node scripts/visual.mjs -g settings   # just the tests, any playwright flag
```

The tests run inside the official Playwright Docker image
(`mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v<@playwright/test version>-jammy`), locally and
in CI, because fonts and text rendering differ between distros and a baseline
only reproduces where it was rendered. `scripts/visual.mjs` starts the
container with `webui/` mounted. You need Docker, but no local browser install.
Running `playwright test -c playwright.visual.config.ts` outside the image
stops with an error. `VISUAL_ON_HOST=1` overrides that for a throwaway probe
spec, but don't compare or update baselines that way.

Both npm scripts run the full `npm run build` first: the app bundle and the
shell bundle (`static/dist/shell.js`). A bare `vite build` empties
`static/dist` and drops `shell.js`, so the page boots without the shell
globals, such as the sidebar "Library / <artist>" breadcrumb. A shot fails
outright when any `/static/` file is missing, so run `npm run build` before
calling `scripts/visual.mjs` on its own.

## What's covered

- **Routes** (`ROUTES`): every main page at 1440×900, plus the key ones at
  768×1024 (`MOBILE_ROUTES`).
- **Below the fold** (`FULL_CONTENT`): long pages also get a `<route>-full.png`.
  The app scrolls inside `.main-content`, so the viewport grows until that
  container stops scrolling, and the whole content is shot at once.
  - Scrolled shots were tried and don't repeat.
  - Two discover panels are masked in the full shot (`FULL_CONTENT_MASKS`);
    the comment there explains why.
- **States** (`STATES`, desktop only): the issue detail modal, a DialogFrame
  modal (podcasts' Add by RSS), the collapsed sidebar, and the issues
  empty/error and stats error states.

## How it works

There is no server. `harness.ts` renders `webui/index.html` the way Flask
would, serves `webui/static` (including the Vite build in `static/dist`) from
disk, and answers every API call.
- `fixtures.ts` holds the API data as MSW `http.*` handlers, the same idiom
  the vitest route tests use. Every route in `ROUTES` that has data gets a
  handler list in `routeHandlers`, and the overlay/error shots use
  `stateHandlers`.
- Anything without a handler gets `{}`, which most pages treat as empty.
- Off-origin requests (cover art, CDNs) are aborted.

Each shot is made repeatable:
- The clock is frozen and `Math.random` is seeded.
- Motion is reduced, the first-launch tip is suppressed, and the test waits
  for the delayed help badge, network quiet and fonts.
- Running CSS animations are cancelled (infinite) or finished (finite) before
  the shot, as the screenshot itself would.

The browser is the image's chromium, pinned by the `@playwright/test` version
in `package-lock.json`.

## When to update the baselines

- **Never in a "no visual change" refactor.** A diff there is a regression, so
  fix the CSS. Look at `test-results/**/<shot>-diff.png` to see what moved (CI
  uploads them as the `visual-diffs` artifact).
- **Only when a change is meant to look different.** Update, eyeball the new
  PNGs in the diff, and call the change out in the PR.
- After a Playwright upgrade, which changes the image and the browser,
  regenerate in a commit of its own. Bump the image tag in
  `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml` to match.

## Adding a shot

- **A route:** add it to `ROUTES` in `routes.visual.spec.ts`. Add it to
  `MOBILE_ROUTES` for a 768px shot, and to `FULL_CONTENT` if it's long.
- **An overlay or state:** add it to `STATES`. `act` opens it once the page has
  settled; `init` runs before load.
- **Data:** give it handlers in `fixtures.ts`. Keep the data small and fixed:
  no `Date.now`, no randomness, null image urls.

Then run `npm run test:visual:update`, and `npm run test:visual -- --repeat-each 5`
to check the new shot repeats.
